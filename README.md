# Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Bike Sharing dataset to understand the impact of temperature on the total rental count (cnt) during working days compared to weekends. The goal is to extract insights that can inform decision-making and potentially enhance the user experience, especially on weekdays with poor weather conditions.

## Questions Addressed
1. **How does temperature (temp) affect the total rental count (cnt) on working days compared to weekends?**
2. **What design ideas or feature ideas could be implemented in the application to increase user engagement on weekdays with bad weather?**

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Bike Sharing dataset, which contains information on bike rentals, including temperature and rental counts, over a specific period. The data is available in CSV format and has been extracted from a ZIP file.

## Installation

1. **Upload the dataset:**
   - Ensure you have the `Bike-sharing-dataset.zip` file ready for upload.

2. **Import Required Libraries:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from google.colab import files

## Feature Suggestions
To improve user engagement on weekdays with bad weather:

1. In-app Notifications: Provide alerts about weather conditions and recommend bike rentals when the weather is manageable.
2. Discounts/Promotions: Offer discounts for bike rentals during poor weather to encourage usage.
3. Weather-based Recommendations: Suggest alternative transportation modes or routes when the weather is bad.

## Acknowledgments
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. """
